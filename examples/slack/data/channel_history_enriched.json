    "text": "Just spoke to each one of you <!channel>. Wanted to thank you all for the great work so far, we built something really cool in a very short time window. There's a good movie I watched yesterday called \"The Boys in the Boat\" which is about a true story of an 8-person rowing team and all their sudden successes. In the movie they highlight how the most important piece behind their success is not how good each rower was, but how the boat moved as 1 not as 8 individual people. I think a lot of our success so far has come from moving as 1, not 4 individuals, through all the standups and challenges. We all leaned into a team mentality and it clearly paid off.\n\nTheir will be less dev and design work over the next few months. We'll still want to problem solve and add key features we identify based on customer feedback. The main focus will be however on GTM, i.e. selling what we have, which I'll be leading. I'll for sure be using Ekho to practice. Our goal there is to get 2-3 more paying betas this year, with 2+ of those converting to annual customers. This should give us enough traction to hopefully transition full-time by end of year/early next.\n\nThis is only the start. Thanks for the hard work.\n\nQuote of the day (from the book The Boys in the Boat): \"All were merged into one smoothly working machine; they were, in fact, a poem of motion, a symphony of swinging blades.\u201d",
