Sarah (PM):
“Alright team, quick round today. Let’s sync on the AI Lead Scoring feature for our CRM. Ali, can you go first?”

⸻

Ali (Backend):
“Sure. Yesterday, I completed the REST endpoint for /leads/score. It accepts the POST payload with lead ID, context object, and optional override flags. The service now asynchronously queues the request into Kafka — topic lead-score-requests — and expects the score from Usman’s scoring microservice via the lead-score-responses topic.”

“The async response is written back to our PostgreSQL lead_scores table, with columns: lead_id, score, confidence, explanation_json, and timestamp. I’m exposing a polling endpoint /leads/score/:id/status for the frontend to check processing state — it’s currently stubbed but will return either PENDING, SUCCESS, or FAILED.”

“Today, I’ll work on securing the endpoint with JWT scopes. I’ll use our existing middleware for crm.write.leads. ETA for prod-ready endpoint: 2 days.”

⸻

Sarah:
“Good. Let’s make sure the explanation in explanation_json is human-readable. Tania?”

⸻

Tania (Frontend):
“I’m working on the Lead Detail view in React. When the lead is scored, we show a badge: Hot, Warm, or Cold, based on the score threshold — above 80 is Hot, below 40 is Cold.”

“We also added a tooltip using react-tooltip that parses the explanation JSON. It includes rules like ‘Visited pricing page 3+ times’, ‘Opened email campaign X’, etc.”

“I’m building a horizontal bar chart with Recharts for visualizing scoring breakdown by feature importance. Usman, I’ll need the schema of explanation_json to map it properly.”

⸻

Usman (ML Engineer):
“Sure, explanation JSON is structured as:

{
  'feature_importance': {
    'page_views': 0.45,
    'email_opens': 0.3,
    'demo_requested': 0.2,
    'form_filled': 0.05
  },
  'final_score': 88,
  'confidence': 0.92
}

“I’m using XGBoost for now with SHAP values to generate the importance. Trained on 2 years of sales-labeled leads, using 23 features — behavioral and firmographic. Model is versioned via MLflow: model:v12. It’s hosted on FastAPI in a container on ECS.”

“I deployed the endpoint /score-lead which accepts the full lead JSON. Response includes score, explanation, and confidence. Today, I’m adding an A/B toggle in the API for fallback model model:v11 just in case.”

⸻

Sarah:
“Excellent. Can we log the SHAP explanations in our feature store for retraining?”

⸻

Usman:
“Yes. I’ll push each scoring instance to our lead_scoring_logs table in S3 via Glue job daily.”

⸻

Hassan (QA):
“I’ve written Cypress tests for score badge rendering, tooltip validation, and polling behavior. I’ll test edge cases today — like malformed JSON in explanation, API timeouts, and fallback model switches.”

⸻

Sarah:
“Perfect. Let’s align tomorrow on release readiness. We need this in staging by Friday EOD. Any blockers?”

⸻

Ali:
“None from me.”

⸻

Tania:
“All good, just need final CSS tweaks on the tooltip.”

⸻

Usman:
“I’ll document the API schema on Confluence today.”

⸻

Hassan:
“I’ll review that once it’s up.”

⸻

Sarah:
“Great. Thanks team. Let’s sync tomorrow — same time.”
