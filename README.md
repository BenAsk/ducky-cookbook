Example code and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the [DuckyAI API](https://docs.ducky.ai/docs/getting-started#/). To run these examples, you'll need an DuckyAI account and associated API key ([create a free account here](https://www.app.ducky.ai/sign-up)). Set an environment variable called `DUCKY_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an `.env` file at the root of your repo containing `DUCKY_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.

Most code examples are written in Python and Typescript, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
